Even though I gradute in Elementary I think I did pretty well because I was never held back in any of my classes. We all make mistakes and sometimes, we don’t even realize we’re making a mistake until someone talks to us about it. I know you don’t know me, but I’m wondering if I can ask for your help. We grown-ups are making a mistake these days but I’m pretty sure you can help us fix it. I’ve talked to a lot of students over the years. I know how much I like spending time outside kicking soccer balls, playing tag, and palying basketball. For many of you, recess is probably your favourite time of the school day because you get to run around and enjoy the fresh air. Playing outside is pretty fun no matter what you do.</blockquote></div>
