			<div class="All"> On my High School Days I was excited to make new friends, yet nervous I would hate every second of it. My first day of High School Days began my long journey of <i>Elementary School Days</i>. During Elementary days I learned that if I have a lots of friends no one tried to bully me, and I was so excited within the first day. It is said that a person always remembers their first day at school and their last day at school. The first day a child remembers because it came there weeping. And the last day a student remembers because they leave school, weeping again. In my case, I remember clearly my first day at school and my last day at the school. The joys of school life are surely countless. Indeed, the school days are the best of our lives.</div>
