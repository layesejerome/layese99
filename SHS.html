			<div class="All"> Senior year is full of memories that you will cherish for the rest of your life. It’s a time to remember how the past four years have impacted your life. It’s an opportunity to thank those who have shaped my character thats my family, friends, teachers, coaches, and other loved ones. It’s a season to plan for the future. On my Senior High School days I have a closed female friend becuase of that veryone thinks that we are couples. All guys need a female best friend in their lives who understands him as no one else does. Having a female best friend allows us to share things that we usually cant with our guy friends. </div>
